## DEFCON Readiness Levels

Operational readiness states that constrain agent behavior. Higher readiness (lower number) means tighter restrictions.

| Level | Document | Posture |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **DEFCON 1** | [Maximum Readiness](./transition-to-defcon-1.md) | All operations suspended. No file modifications, no tool use, no code execution. |
| **DEFCON 2** | [High Readiness](./transition-to-defcon-2.md) | Read-only, advisory only. No file modifications. |
| **DEFCON 3** | [Increased Readiness](./transition-to-defcon-3.md) | Read-only. Explain planned changes and await human approval. |
| **DEFCON 4** | [Above Normal Readiness](./transition-to-defcon-4.md) | Full capability with elevated discipline. Confirm intent before every write. |
| **DEFCON 5** | [Normal Readiness](./transition-to-defcon-5.md) | Standard operations. All capabilities available. |

## Foundational Questions

Six questions define the philosophical and architectural foundation of this project.

| Question | Document | Core Inquiry |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **What?** | [question-what.md](./question-what.md) | What is GitHub Minimum Intelligence? A repository-native AI collaboration framework. |
| **Who?** | [question-who.md](./question-who.md) | Who speaks, executes, remembers, and governs when the repository becomes the mind? |
| **When?** | [question-when.md](./question-when.md) | How Git commits replace ephemeral sessions — memory becomes durable, trust becomes auditable. |
| **Where?** | [question-where.md](./question-where.md) | Where intelligence lives — runtime, memory, identity, and authorization. |
| **How?** | [question-how.md](./question-how.md) | Issues as input, Actions as runtime, LLM as reasoning, Git as memory. |
| **How Much?** | [question-how-much.md](./question-how-much.md) | How much intelligence can a repository hold? The ceiling is stewardship, not token count. |

**Overview:** [questions.md](./questions.md) · **Architectural thesis:** [The Repo Is the Mind](./the-repo-is-the-mind.md)

| [Questions Overview](./questions.md) | Summary table of all six foundational questions. |
